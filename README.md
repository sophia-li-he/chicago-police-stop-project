# What Factors Affect Getting Tickets on Chicago Tollway

# Installation
The libraries/packages used are:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn

# Project Motivation
The project is part of the [Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) - Term2. It analyzes [Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/) dataset for Chicago Tollway in Illinois State. 

The dataset contains below information:
- Date and time of the stop
- Demographics information of the driver (race, gender, age)
- Violation type (speeding, seat belt, license...)
- Whether search is conducted
- Whether contraband found
- Whether the drive received a ticket

The questions that this project is trying to answer are:
The questions that I am interested in are:
- Do gender and race affect violation type?
- Do gender and race affect who gets a ticket (for speeding)?
- Do gender and race affect whose vehicle is searched?
- Do time of the day affect search rate?
- What factors affect getting tickets on Chicago Tollway?

# File Descriptions
- This notebook `Analyzing Police Stop Data - Chicago Tollway.ipynb` answers the business questions listed above using descriptive analysis and a simple logistic regression model. It follows on lines of Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM).
- The dataset can be downloaded from the [Stanford Open Policing Project Website](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/).

# Results
The main findings fo the code can be found at the Medium Post available [here](https://medium.com/@sophiaheli/what-factors-affect-getting-tickets-on-chicago-tollway-c0033d042bc7).
